In this assignment, we design a bracket to hold the brushed gearmotor to the PCB. Some of the trickier aspects of the design were to set the fillets on the interior to a small enough dimension (0.25mm here) so that it wouldn't interfere with the dimensions of the brushed motor. 
Find attached a .STEP and a .SLDPRT file for the designed bracket in the homework folder.
