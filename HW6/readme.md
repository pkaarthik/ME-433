**HW6**

In this assignment, I use Eagle CAD (free version) to design a circuit diagram, and it's PCB for the final project system in ME 433.

Note: Please find screenshots of the board, cropped for a more zoomed in view and a more full view. 

Note: The PololuDVR8835 uses a DIL-14 footprint despite not exactly matching the same footprint, since the pin spacing and column width of the DVR8835 matches a DIL14 footprint layout.
